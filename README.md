This is a spin-off of the original [Heardle](https://www.heardle.app/) but for Trisha Yearwood songs. Each song is randomly chosen from her discography. I do not own any rights to the songs used in this game. All copyright goes to Trisha Yearwood and other relevant parties.

FYI: I am not a web developer. If you find a bug or have any questions, DM me on Twitter ([@melismcdaniel](https://twitter.com/melismcdaniel)).
